Q1: When the user chooses "Cancel", the message is the same as when choosing "No" .
Q2: Instead of using showConfirmDialog() method of JOptionPane class, the right method will be showOptionDialog() of the same class. 
    An array of available options should be created to easily store the options and pass them to the method.
    A version of the choices "I do" and "I don't" has the directory : LAB1/6.1/ChoosingOption2.java
