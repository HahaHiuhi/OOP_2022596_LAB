In swap: Java passes the object references by value. 
Changing the local variables (o1 and o2) inside swap does not affect the original references (jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD) 
because only the local copies of the references are modified, not the original references themselves.

In changeTitle: The dvd reference in the changeTitle method points to the same object as jungleDVD, 
so changes to the properties of dvd (like calling dvd.setTitle) modify the same object that jungleDVD points to. 
However, creating a new DVD with new DVD(oldTitle) only affects the local dvd reference inside changeTitle and does not change the reference of jungleDVD in main.
